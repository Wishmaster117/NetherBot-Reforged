# NetherBot-Reforged Tool for  [trickerer/Trinity-Bots](https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots)
Reforge of NetherstormX’s NetherBot Add-on

NetherBot, originally created by NetherstormX, is an add-on for NPCBots on TrinityCore and AzerothCore 3.3.5 that provides quick and easy access to various bot-related commands.

I decided to enhance it by fixing bugs and adding missing features.

All NPCBot operations are now driven entirely through the in-game interface—no more typing out bot commands—while still offering the familiar /netherbot show / /netherbot hide chat commands and a handy minimap button to toggle the window.

## What’s New

- **Fully UI-Driven**  
  All core NPCBot features—spawn, delete, add, move, lookup info, follow/standstill/stop, adjust follow distance—are exposed via buttons, dropdowns and context menus. No slash-line arguments needed for bot management.

- **Minimap Button**  
  A new icon on your minimap lets you show or hide the NetherBot panel with a single click, alongside the existing chat commands.

- **Enhanced Localization**  
  Locale detection and translations happen automatically in the interface—no manual locale flags required.
